# PortfolioV1
This is the version one of my Portfolio. 

This is a good practice on how to put together a website.
It  was challenging dealing with a lot of CSS and HTML attributes. Having to deal with them individually was difficult when resizing for different screen sizes.

I chose a simple design because I didn't want to do a complex one with out having the basic grid elements and functioning figured out. Also, for the projects part I put placeholder images from the languages we're learning, because I don't have any projects to show.
